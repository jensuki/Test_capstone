IMAGIME
Database Schema:

Tables for:
Users: Contains user account information (username, email, password, profile image).
Posts: Stores information related to user posts (image, description, associated user ID).
Songs: Details about songs retrieved from the Spotify API (title, artist, preview URL, album artwork).
PostSong: A join table linking posts to songs, enabling multiple songs to be associated with a single post.
FavoritedSongs: Tracks songs favorited by users, linking both the user and the specific song.
API Issues:

Spotipy API: Handle data inconsistencies from the Spotify API, such as missing preview URLs or album images. Ensure robust error handling when fetching song details based on keywords.
Everypixel API: Manage potential mismatches between keywords generated from uploaded images and available songs on Spotify. Implement error handling when no keywords are found or when the keyword-to-song mapping fails.
Sensitive Information:

User Account Details: Securely store user credentials and profile images. Ensure encryption and safe handling of passwords. Manage user sessions to prevent unauthorized access.
Uploaded Images: Protect personal or sensitive content in user-uploaded images.
Functionality:

Image and Song Integration: Users upload an image, which is analyzed to generate keywords that map to related songs from the Spotify API. These songs are displayed alongside the image.
Favorites System: Users can favorite songs associated with any post. Favorited songs are stored in the database, and users do not see the favorited status unless they also favorited the song.
Dynamic Content Loading: Implement a "Load More" button to load additional songs without a full page reload, enhancing user experience.
User Flow:

Sign-Up/Login: New users create an account with a username, email, and optional profile image. Existing users log in to access personalized content.
Post Creation: Users upload images and optionally add descriptions. The app matches the image to songs based on generated keywords.
Interaction with Content: Users view posts, listen to preview songs, and favorite tracks. They can also view a list of favorited songs and navigate back to the original post from the favorited songs list.
Stretch Goals:

Enhanced Recommendations: Suggest songs or images based on a userâ€™s favorited content.
Community Features: Allow users to comment on posts, share favorite posts, or rank songs/images.
Advanced Search Options: Enable users to search posts by keywords, song titles, or users. Implement filtering options for refined searches.
Custom Playlists: Allow users to create playlists based on favorited songs or matched songs from uploaded images.
